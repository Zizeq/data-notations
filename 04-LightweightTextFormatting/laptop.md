## What is a laptop?
* A **_[laptop][wiki]_** 
 computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). 
  * Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.
## Types of Laptops
#### **Smaller and larger laptops**
* There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included "notebook" and "subnotebook" models, low cost "netbooks", and "ultra-mobile PCs" where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and "Desktop replacement" laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware.


#### **Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1**
* The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.

#### **Rugged laptop**
* A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.

## Laptop Hardware
* The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.

   1. **Screen technology**
    * Laptop screens most commonly employ liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology, although use of [OLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED) panels has risen substantially since 2020.
   2. **Resolution**
    * Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user's ability to multitask, although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area.
   3. **Central processing unit (CPU)**
    * A laptop's [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU) has advanced power-saving features and produces less heat than one intended purely for desktop use. Mainstream laptop CPUs made after 2018 have at least two processor cores, often four cores, and sometimes more, with 6 and 8 cores becoming more common.
   4. **Graphics processing unit (GPU)**
    * On most laptops, the GPU is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the Core i-series of mobile processors in 2010, followed by similar AMD APU processors in January 2011.
   5. **Memory**
    * Since around the year 2000, most laptops have used SO-DIMM slots in which [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM) is mounted, although, as of 2021, an increasing number of models use memory soldered to the motherboard, either alongside SO-DIMM slots or without any slots and soldering all memory to the motherboard, but a new form factor, the CAMM module, is slated to fix the size and timing limitation.
